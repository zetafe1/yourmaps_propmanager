# YourMAPS Prop Manager
Here you have a free, optimized, and flexible script to manage props in RedM, adding and deleting!

While the best method for placing or deleting objects in RedM is by editing binary .YMAP or .YTYP files using tools like Codex by Dexyfex, this script provides an excellent alternative for server admins who prefer not to modify binary files or deal with the complexity of MLO editing.

This tool allows you to:

    Delete all objects dynamically within a defined polyzone (deleteAll = true).
    Delete specific objects only (deleteAll = false).
    Spawn objects dynamically at set locations.
    Remove spawned objects when leaving the area (preventing performance issues).
    Optimize RedM performance by avoiding the outdated and inefficient XML method.

No need to modify .YMAP or .YTYP files.
Avoids using the old XML method, which is bad for performance.
A free alternative to paid prop management scripts.
Simple to configure via config.lua.
Performance optimized (avoids unnecessary object duplication and excessive processing).

**Open Source & Free to Use**

This script is free to use and modify for your RedM RP Server.

To get coords to spawn object as vec3(x,y,z) and rotation vec3(x,y,z) of your spawned prop you can use Spooner export as Script or YourMAPS CoordsTool.

This tool is a great alternative to manually editing binary MLO files or using paid prop management scripts. It gives server owners more control over world props.
