# YourMAPS Prop Manager
Here you have a free, optimized, and flexible script for placing and managing props in RedM.

While the best method for placing objects in RedM is by editing binary .YMAP or .YTYP files using tools like Codex by Dexyfex, this script provides a great alternative for those who want to avoid the learning how to edit binary .YMAP & .YTYP or the XML cleaning props method, which is notorious for negatively impacting server performance.

This tool offers a better and free alternative to paid scripts solutions while avoiding outdated and inefficient XML methods this will help you to manage the undesired props in the world or inside MLO on your RP Server. 

Enjoy a smoother mapping experience in RedM!
